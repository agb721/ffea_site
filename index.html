        <p></p>
        <div class="HeroSecondary">The Florida First Energy Alliance is a coalition of Floridians which, guided by the principles of conservatism and limited government, aims to address the energy and environmental challenges of today.  We believe that the best way to accomplish this is through market-based solutions, private-sector leadership, and technological innovation. <br> <br> 

            Central to our effort is the mindset of putting Florida first. We believe we must be unapologetic about advocating for solutions that will best protect the Floridian people and safeguard our state’s economy, unique natural heritage, and quality of life. <br> <br>
            
            We know that environmental stewardship can be done without compromising our state’s economic growth, and that a key component to addressing the climate challenge is holding foreign polluters accountable for their pollution. <br> <br>
            
            Without leadership, Florida’s economic health and flourishing will continue to be put at risk, and for that reason, we commit ourselves to acting boldly today. We will urge our elected officials to advance economically sound solutions and ensure a cleaner, more competitive Florida for future generations.
